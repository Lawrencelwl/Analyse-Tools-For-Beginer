Abstract :

The "Incomplete Data Analysis Using Machine Learning" project explored the traditional statistical approaches and some machine learning models for handling the missing data method. By researching the method of finding out which method is better. Also, there will be a data analysis tool for which the target users are beginners in data analysis provided. After the research, the machine learning model have more performance in handling the missing data. Therefore, the tool will use DataWig and neural networks to handle the missing data. Both of them are machine learning models. Furthermore, this tool will decrease the complexity of analyzing a data set with missing data and let them can enjoy learning the data analyzing.

Environment :

1. Python - 3.7.16
2. datawig
3. PyQt5
4. matplotlib
5. keras
6. tensorflow 

Install Guide : 

1. create an Anaconda with Python 3.7.16.
2. Run the file called "install_datawig.py"
3. Go to the terminal and install PyQt5, matplotlib, keras and tensorflow.
4. Run the "main_form.py"
